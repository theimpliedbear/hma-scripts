The easiest way to use these scripts and understand them is to start with the export script. copy paste the python code exactly into Hex Maniac Advance's Automation Tool (ctrl+r)
The automatic path to the export is C:\Exports. You can change this easily in the first few lines of the code. Open your csv in a spreadsheet program to edit the pokemon table.
IMPORTANT: This is the EXACT format that the csv file needs to be. Changing column names or rearranging could break it. I would not recommend it.
To use the import script, your new pokemon data must be stored in the same format of .csv. this is why it's helpful to export first, so you can use that as a template.
YOU MUST DO THIS STEP FOR IMPORTS TO WORK: Make a new folder inside the exports folder called "Imports"and save a copy of your .csv inside with the name your_pokemon_data.csv
Copy and paste the import script into the Automation Tool. Please note this overwrites the data for all pokemon. 
To leave some unchanged, simply leave them alone in the .csv between the export and import and they should be unchanged.
